## Workaround for ExtendScript Toolkit Debugger Error #1116
To run scripts with ExtendScript Toolkit, you'll need to [implement the workaround for ExtendScript Toolkit debugger error #1116](https://medium.com/adobetech/workaround-for-extendscript-toolkit-debugger-error-1116-f067f81f96c6).

# Another option

Since early 2019, Adobe has provided the [VSCode ExtendScript Debugger plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.extendscript-debug). This does not replace all the capabilities of ExtendScript Toolkit, so youâ€™ll want to be sure that it will meet your needs before you upgrading to a 64-bit only OS.
